# tinkerscope — agent orientation

Browser playground for **Tinker-trained checkpoints** that **auto-discovers
training runs** under a directory tree (scans for `checkpoints.jsonl` /
`config.json`), lets you chat with / sample from them, and is **drivable live
from the terminal** via the `tinkpg` CLI. Forked from Harry Mayne's playground;
see `README.md` for the full feature list + credits.

## Doc map (read this first)

| Doc | What it's for | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | User-facing: what it does, how to run, the CLI, tests | current |
| `docs/API_CONTRACT.md` | Authoritative HTTP endpoint + SSE event shapes (incl. `/api/conversations` + the branch-tree shape) | current |
| `docs/BRANCHING_DESIGN.md` | **As-built design + contract for conversation branching** (tree model, fold/reconcile rules, persistence, known limits). The source of truth for the feature | current |
| `docs/HANDOFF_BRANCHING.md` | Historical planning record for branching (what Clément asked vs what I inferred — §2–§4 = the requirements). §5 = the highlight-UI overhaul (now shipped — see `docs/TODO.md`) | branching + §5 both shipped |
| `docs/HANDOFF_MULTIPANEL.md` | **N-way model comparison workspace — SHIPPED** (`panels[]`, `trees` map + back-compat migration, add/remove/reduce panels, composer send-targeting, send-branch-to-panel, N-run CLI `compare`). §9 = the as-built grounded plan + locked decisions (architecture B; per-conversation persistence; global params; stable panel ids). §5 = the original 2-panel site-map | shipped; per-conversation panel *layout* now persists too (switch restores a conv's model set; new conv inherits the current one's models, Shift+new = blank — see `Conversation.panels` in `docs/API_CONTRACT.md`); follow-ups: the §4 small items |
| `docs/TODO.md` | Roadmap (branching marked done) | current |
| `deprecated/HANDOFF.md` | Original tool-build handoff (Harry's playground → tinkerscope). Build done; file refs predate the `src/tinkerscope/` restructure | deprecated, kept for history |

The durable knowledge HANDOFF.md once held now lives in code docstrings (below)
and in this file's reference section; HANDOFF.md itself is retired.

## Working conventions

- **Committing — no need to ask first.** Commit straight to `main` whenever work
  is at a clean, verified point; show the diff summary of what landed, don't gate
  on approval (Clément's standing preference for this repo — overrides the global
  "always ask before committing"). A `web/` pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`,
  wired via `core.hooksPath`) runs `npm run build` and aborts the commit on a build
  failure; bypass a deliberate WIP commit with `git commit --no-verify`.
- **Deploys / "my change isn't showing".** A running instance never live-reloads:
  a backend (Python) change needs a process restart; a web change needs
  `npm run build` (the pre-commit hook runs it on every `web/` commit) and then
  only a browser refresh — `main.py:_web_dist()` serves `web/dist` from disk per
  request. If installing as a uv tool, install **editable** (`uv tool install -e .`)
  so the process runs this checkout; a plain `uv tool install .` freezes a wheel
  whose bundled `web_dist` snapshot never updates again. For HMR iteration on
  *uncommitted* web edits, `./run.sh <dir>` starts a vite dev server + its own
  backend. (Where the user's live instance actually runs — port, service, scan
  root — is machine state: it lives in Claude's project memory, not in this file.)

## Where the contracts live (source of truth = code, not docs)

- **Discovery contract** (the two files every `tinker_cookbook` run drops —
  `config.json` + `checkpoints.jsonl`, their fields, the scan, defensive
  parsing, sampleability gating): `src/tinkerscope/api/discovery.py` — the
  module docstring + the `Checkpoint` / `Run` dataclasses document it. Key
  gotcha encoded there: **sample from `sampler_path`, not `state_path`.**
- **Inference / sampling** (renderer selection, the thinking on/off toggle and
  its two naming conventions, thinking-block parsing, prefill, per-sample
  streaming + cancel-on-disconnect): `src/tinkerscope/api/tinker_sampler.py` —
  docstrings are thorough and current. tinkerscope calls the **tinker SDK
  directly** now; the old latteries path is gone (its renderer-cache and
  thinking-parse *lessons* carried over into this file).
- **Shared-state bus / live-drive** (the `tinkpg` ↔ browser lockstep): see
  `docs/HANDOFF_BRANCHING.md` §1 + `src/tinkerscope/api/state.py`.

## Frontend map (`web/` — Svelte 5 / SvelteKit SPA)

Read this before a UI task instead of Exploring `web/`. The UI is a single-route
SvelteKit SPA under `web/src`. Three kinds of file, by suffix:

- **Stores** — `*.svelte.ts` exporting a class instance as a singleton (runes in
  a module; this is the house pattern). Reactive `$state` fields read/written
  across the app:
  - `lib/state.svelte.ts` → `live` — mirrored shared `PlaygroundState` (selection/
    params) + per-panel **streamed sample buckets**, both driven by the
    `/api/state/events` SSE. The render bus.
  - `lib/conversations.svelte.ts` → `convo` — owner of the per-panel **branch
    trees** + persistence + the external-fold reconcile. The conversation model.
  - `lib/chat.svelte.ts` → `chat` — the **generation-fire lifecycle**: POST
    `/api/chat`, drain, fold under the user node, per-panel abort controllers +
    the live-bucket prefill color. UI-agnostic — the caller (+page) passes a
    `ChatParams` bundle + a resolved `ChatModelField`, so it never touches the
    sampling UI. +page keeps thin glue (`paramsBundle`/`resolveModelField`/a
    `fireOne` wrapper) over it.
  - `lib/highlights.svelte.ts` → `highlightStore` — user-defined render-time
    coloring rules + persistence.
  - `lib/scroll.svelte.ts` → `panelScroll` — **the only scrollTop writer**: the
    per-panel FOLLOW (streaming, stick-to-bottom gated) / PRESERVE (tree
    mutations keep position) / SNAP (send, conversation open) / REVEAL
    (keyboard focus moved off-screen → minimal container-only scroll) policy.
    Its module docstring records why (the old global bottom-pin = the scroll
    flicker). New scroll behavior goes through this store, never inline.
- **Pure logic** — plain `.ts`, no Svelte/DOM, unit-testable (some have
  `*.test.ts`):
  - `lib/tree.ts` — all branch-tree ops (activePath, fold, regen, edit, delete,
    cycle, siblings). The single source of branching truth. **Has `tree.test.ts`.**
  - `lib/model-sel.ts` — the `openrouter:`/`base:`/`ckpt:` sentinel encoding
    (prefixes, predicates, id extractors) for a panel's model selection.
  - `lib/chart.ts` — distribution-chart bucketing: `chartByRules` (samples
    bucketed by the SET of matching highlight rules — grey none / solid single /
    striped combo) + `chartByAnswers` (legacy exact-match histogram) + label
    helpers. **Has `chart.test.ts`.**
  - `lib/kbnav.ts` — keyboard row-navigation helpers: nav-key set, clamped
    focus-index stepping, the typing-target/modal-open guards. Consumed by
    +page's *Keyboard row navigation* section (click a row → focus ring; ↑/↓
    walk the panel view, ←/→ = the row's ‹k/N› cycler, Esc clears). **Has
    `kbnav.test.ts`**; browser smoke `tests/small-smokes/browser_kbnav.py`.
  - `lib/chat-stream.ts` — `drainSamples`: parse the `/api/chat` SSE into samples.
  - `lib/highlight-match.ts` / `lib/highlight-render.ts` — pure matching + the
    markdown+math+highlight render pipeline. **`highlight.test.ts`.**
  - `lib/render.ts` — store-coupled render entry point (wraps highlight-render).
  - `lib/api.ts` — typed backend client + named-event SSE helper.
  - `lib/types.ts` — TS types mirroring the backend (see `docs/API_CONTRACT.md`).
  - `lib/tooltip.svelte.ts` — the `use:tip` tooltip action.
- **Components** — `.svelte`:
  - `routes/+page.svelte` — **the workspace component**: wires every store +
    handler to the markup. Still the biggest file (~2.2k lines); organized by
    `// ── Section ──` banner comments — **`grep '// ──' routes/+page.svelte`
    for the in-file table of contents** rather than scrolling. Notable sections:
    *Send a chat* (`sendMessage` + the `fireOne` wrapper — the core send path;
    the fire/abort/fold machinery itself is in `lib/chat.svelte.ts`), *Chat-thread
    branching* (edit/regenerate/delete/cycle/select — the largest cluster),
    *Conversation rendering* (`panelView`/`bucketTurn` — overlays the live bucket
    on the tree's active leaf), *Panel lifecycle* (add/remove panels),
    *Keyboard row navigation* (the ONE focused row + arrow-key handler over
    `lib/kbnav.ts`), *Conversation ↔ URL sync*, *Session persistence*,
    *Lifecycle* (`onMount`).
    Markup order: sidebar → chat area → input bar → the modal components below.
  - `lib/Modal.svelte` — shared modal chrome (overlay, header, close,
    click-outside, Escape, body slot). Every modal wraps this; `modalStyle`
    overrides the box width per modal.
  - `lib/ChartModal.svelte`, `lib/TagModal.svelte`, `lib/DatasetModal.svelte`,
    `lib/SlideshowModal.svelte`, `lib/OrManagerModal.svelte`,
    `lib/TinkerPickerModal.svelte` — the six workspace modals. Each owns its body
    + specific styles; the parent passes data in and gets results via callbacks.
    ChartModal is the smart one: it receives per-panel per-turn samples
    (reactive; live-updates mid-stream) and owns mode toggle / turn picker
    (defaults to the LATEST turn) / match-thinking / click-a-segment-to-inspect.
    Deterministic smoke (seeded tree, no sampling):
    `tests/small-smokes/browser_chart_rules.py`.
  - `lib/ChatMessage.svelte` — one chat row (committed node OR live bucket turn)
    + its per-row toolbar (edit/regen/branch/pin…).
  - `lib/ModelTypeahead.svelte` — the type-to-filter model combobox (used by the
    OpenRouter + Tinker picker modals, and as the panel body of `ModelDropdown`).
  - `lib/ModelDropdown.svelte` — select-like trigger button + floating panel
    wrapping `ModelTypeahead`; the sidebar's per-panel model picker (click →
    type to filter, no separate "Filter models…" textbox).
  - `lib/HighlightRules.svelte` — the highlight-rules editor UI.

Cross-component CSS utility classes (`.sidebar-label`, `.btn-new`,
`.backend-error`, …) live in **global `app.css`** — scoped `+page.svelte` styles
don't reach extracted components, so shared classes must be global.

**Modules > the mega-file.** When adding UI, prefer a new/existing `lib/` module
or component over growing `+page.svelte`: pure logic → `.ts` (+ a `.test.ts`),
shared reactive state → a `*.svelte.ts` store, a self-contained UI block → a
`.svelte` component (wrap `Modal.svelte` for a dialog). Runtime smokes for the
extracted UI: `tests/small-smokes/browser_{chart_modal,modals}.py`.

## External reference paths (not in this repo; verified 2026-06-22)

- Tinker checkpoint schema (`CheckpointRecord`):
  `~/research-libs/tinker-cookbook/tinker_cookbook/checkpoint_utils.py:28`
- `tinker_cookbook` source tree: `~/research-libs/tinker-cookbook/`
- Where `config.json`'s shape is *defined* (this project's `Config`; other
  Tinker projects may differ): `~/projects2/negation_neglect/src/train/{custom_sft,tinker}.py`

## Box facts

- `TINKER_API_KEY` is **set** (remote sampling works today). `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
  needed only for OpenRouter reference models.
- Test fixtures: **26 real run dirs** under
  `~/projects2/negation_neglect/datasets/training_datasets/` + the
  `~/projects2/weird-personas` runs (each has `config.json` + `checkpoints.jsonl`).
  **Sampleability is a ROLLING WINDOW, not fixed:** Tinker serves only the last
  ~14 sampler checkpoints (~6 weeks); a run samples iff its sampler UUID is still
  servable. Two failure modes show greyed-out / 404: (a) base model no longer served
  (e.g. `Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base`); (b) sampler_weights aged out of the window — and
  **`sampleable: true` does NOT catch (b)** (the probe only checks the base model),
  so aged-out runs look green and only 404 on actual sample. Find a live run by
  cross-referencing `tinker_oai.list_checkpoints()` / `GET /api/tinker-models`, or use
  `tests/small-smokes/_smoke_models.{LIVE_RUN_ID,pick_servable_run}`. **Live as of
  2026-06-22:** the `04_2026-06-16_rationalization` deepseek/kimi runs (weird-personas);
  all April negation_neglect runs have aged out.
- CPU-only box; sampling is remote so no GPU/vLLM/LoRA-conversion needed locally.

## Build / verify

See `docs/HANDOFF_BRANCHING.md` §6 for dev (HMR), typecheck+build, and browser-smoke
commands. Python tests: `uv run pytest -q` (no remote calls — capabilities
probe is stubbed).
